### ‚òï Java Management System

**The Problem It Solves**
*   **Previously**: Users would encounter `UnsupportedClassVersionError` when running new Minecraft versions with outdated Java.
*   **Currently**: The system functions automatically without these errors.

**How It Works**
*   **Automatic Detection**: Identifies the server's Minecraft version from its core files.
*   **Smart Download**: Fetches the correct Java version from trusted sources like Eclipse Adoptium.
*   **Automatic Linking**: Ensures each server instance uses the appropriate Java runtime.
*   **Efficient Management**: Reuses existing Java installations for other compatible servers.

**Version Compatibility**
| Minecraft Version   | Required Java | Status                 |
|:--------------------|:--------------|:-----------------------|
| 1.21+               | Java 21       | ‚úÖ Automatic Download |

### ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Installation Issues**
*   **Q: What should I do if Python is not installed?**
    A: Download Python from python.org. During installation, ensure the "Add Python to PATH" option is checked.
*   **Q: The automatic installer is not working. What can I do?**
    A: Follow the manual installation instructions. Ensure you have the necessary administrative permissions if required.

**Java Issues**
*   **Q: I already have Java installed. Why is the application downloading another version?**
    A: The application downloads specific, sandboxed versions of Java to guarantee compatibility and prevent conflicts with system-wide installations. This is intended behavior.
*   **Q: Can I use my existing system Java installation?**
    A: Yes. If a compatible system-wide Java version is detected, the application may use it. However, its internal manager is designed to prevent version conflicts.

**Server Issues**
*   **Q: My server fails to start. How can I diagnose the issue?**
    A: Check the server logs in the console tab. The application will display specific errors and may provide suggestions.
*   **Q: How can I import an existing server?**
    A: In the initial setup wizard, select "Use Existing Server" and navigate to your server's root folder.

**"Make Public" Functionality**
*   **Q: Is it safe to make my server public?**
    A: This feature uses a public tunneling service. It should only be used with trusted individuals. We strongly recommend configuring a whitelist for your server.
*   **Q: Why does the public address change with each session?**
    A: This is standard for free tunneling services, which generate dynamic addresses upon connection.

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

*   **Review Logs**: The application's console provides detailed error messages for diagnostics.
*   **Restart the Application**: A simple restart can resolve many temporary issues.

**Getting Help**
*   **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs or request new features on the project's GitHub page.

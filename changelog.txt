# Application Changelog

## Version 1.2.2 - YYYY-MM-DD
- Implemented view transitions: Added a subtle "dip to background" fade effect when switching between different sections/tabs in the GUI for a smoother user experience.

**Core UI Enhancements & Modernization:**
- Replaced placeholder top bar with a functional header:
    - Includes "Minecraft Server Dashboard" title.
    - Dynamic server status label (Offline, Online, Starting, Stopping, Restarting) with distinct styles.
    - "Restart Server" button, dynamically enabled/disabled.
- Implemented `restart_server` and `_check_if_stopped_then_start` methods for robust server restarting.
- Standardized typography for section headers within views (e.g., "Connected Players") using `Header.TLabel`.
- Improved scrollbar aesthetics (`Vertical.TScrollbar`) for better dark theme integration (trough color, thumb background, flat relief).
- Refined particle animation for subtlety: reduced particle count, more subdued colors, smaller size and speed.
- Standardized `ScrolledText` widget styling (console, config editors, changelog) to `flat` relief with a 1px border.

**Layout & Style Improvements by View:**
- **Dashboard View:**
    - Refactored "Server Controls" (Start/Stop buttons) and "Server Console" into separate, parallel `Card.TFrame` widgets.
- **General List Views (Treeview Replacement & Actionable Rows):**
    - Updated `CardView.Treeview` selection style: `ACCENT_COLOR` background, `PRIMARY_BG` foreground for clarity (where Treeview is still used or was recently replaced).
    - **Worlds View:** Replaced Treeview. Each world row now displays name/size and a "üíæ Backup" button.
    - **Mods View:** Replaced `mods_tree` with a scrollable list. Each mod row shows JAR name/config path, with "‚öôÔ∏è View" and "üóëÔ∏è Del" buttons. Implemented `_load_mod_config_for_editing` and `_delete_specific_mod`.
    - **Bans View:** Replaced `banned_ips_tree` and `banned_players_tree`. Each ban entry shows details and a "‚öñÔ∏è Pardon" button. Implemented `_pardon_ip` and `_pardon_player`.
    - **Players View:** Replaced `players_tree`. Each player row displays name, with "üë¢ Kick" and "üö´ Ban" buttons. Refactored kick/ban methods.
    - **Ops View:** Replaced `ops_tree`. Each operator row displays details and a "‚ö° DeOp" button. Implemented `_deop_player(name)`.
- **Server Properties View:**
    - Enhanced `Switch.TCheckbutton` style for clearer on/off visual (green/grey).
    - Refactored `_add_property_control` to pack controls side-by-side in a parent row frame.
    - Significantly updated `load_server_properties` for a multi-column layout (2-3 properties per row) for compactness.
    - Fixed `AttributeError` for `property_row_frames` initialization.
- **Input Fields & Dropdowns (`TEntry`, `TCombobox`):**
    - Added hover effects: `bordercolor` to `ACCENT_HOVER`, `fieldbackground` to `SECONDARY_BG`.
    - Increased `borderwidth` to 2px on focus/hover, reverting to 1px otherwise.
- **Button Styles:**
    - Created `ActionRow.TButton` style for small inline action buttons in list rows (smaller font, reduced padding).
    - Removed explicit `ipadx`/`ipady` from main action buttons to rely on style padding for consistency.
- **Spacing and Padding Review:**
    - Adjusted padding in Properties view (canvas, individual property controls).
    - Adjusted padding in Resources view (main card, title, graph frame).
    - Adjusted padding in Stats view (main card, title).

**Other:**
- Added "App Settings" tab with Application Information and a read-only Changelog viewer.
